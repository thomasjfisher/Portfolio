## Description of Website

The purpose of building my portfolio website, is so that I may use it to show off in a professional field. It is a great way to share my work, and my information, and a great asset to networking. I also have projects that I have worked on previously in my coding journey, and a blog space to share my content.



## Functionality and Feature

The idea behind my website was to make sure that it was accessible and easy to use. I want to make sure that there are no loops to ensure that any user will not be chasing their tail.

Using multiple background images to create a diverse look but tying it together with similar styles is a feature that I am very proud of. Making sure that its interesting to look at, read and navigate.

Creating a 'home' icon at the top left of each screen the user can navigate to so that they can get back to the home page in one click.

Creating icons that change colour when hovering, and linking to their relative destination. GitHub, LinkedIn, Twitter, my sites homepage are some that I have utilised in this project.



## Site Map

In the original design of my wireframes, I wanted to make sure that my site was simple, elegant and functional. I created the webframes with that in mind which help guide my design of my site map. I again wanted to ensure that my work was accessible and easy to find and read.

^The above image is a screenshot from my phone. Google Chrome Dev Tools only linked and showed my resume when I was viewing as desktop view, but it does work on iPhone and iPad, tested myself.



## Target Audience

My target audience is future employers, fellow developers and friends. It is such a great way to show off work and previous projects to anyone who wants to see it, all with a few clicks or pushes of their fingers.



## Tech Stack

The skills I used throughout this project are: html5, css3, devtools, GitHub, Netlify, branching, fontawesome, Whimsical,  w3schools (a lot of w3schools), our Canvas lectures, powerpoint, Lucid Chart and ColorsInspo(colour pallets). I tried my hand at scss, but I think as I am still getting my head around the use of html and css, it was a bit much for me to squeeze all into one project at this time.
