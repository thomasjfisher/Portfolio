## Description of Website

The purpose of building my portfolio website, is so that I may use it to show off in a professional field. It is a great way to share my work, and my information, and a great asset to networking. I also have projects that I have worked on previously in my coding journey, and a blog space to share my content.



## Functionality and Feature

The idea behind my website was to make sure that it was accessible and easy to use. I want to make sure that there are no loops to ensure that any user will not be chasing their tail.

Using multiple background images to create a diverse look but tying it together with similar styles is a feature that I am very proud of. Making sure that its interesting to look at, read and navigate.

Creating a 'home' icon at the top left of each screen the user can navigate to so that they can get back to the home page in one click.

## Target Audience

My target audience is future employers, fellow developers and friends. It is such a great way to show off work and previous projects to anyone who wants to see it, all with a few clicks or pushes of their fingers.



## Tech Stack

The skills I used throughout this project are: html5, css3, devtools, GitHub, Netlify, branching, Whimsical,  w3schools (a lot of w3schools), our Canvas lectures, powerpoint, Lucid Chart and ColorsInspo(colour pallets). I tried my hand at scss, but I think as I am still getting my head around the use of html and css, it was a bit much for me to squeeze all into one project at this time.
